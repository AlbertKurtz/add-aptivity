# add-aptivity
Add-aptivity is a simple project that simulates a 2D box containing many colored balls that move and bounce around.
The scene is also drawn on a tkinter canvas.
Movement is via Newton's equations of motion, interaction is Coulomb-like.

This is a small exercise that I did to learn a little bit of classes and OOP.

All comments/critics/suggestions are more than welcome!
